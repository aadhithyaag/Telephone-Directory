Telephone Directory using Linked Lists

This is a project I have done for School which involves storing contacts of various people using the Singly Linked List data structure. The main motive nehind doing this project is because now-a-days everyone has a smartphone using which they can call any person through the tap of a finger. That is possible only because they have stored the contact details in the phone's directory. No one has the time to remember mobile or landline numbers, type them out and then perform calls. Hence I went forward with this topic for a cool project.<br/>

Some important features include: <br/>
**1. Adding new contacts. Details include First Name, Last Name and Phone Number.**<br/>
**2. Searching for a particular contact using either First Name, Last Name or Phone Number.**<br/>
**3. Editing an exisiting contact in case of any updation in contact details such as new phone number of the particular person.**<br/>
**4. Deleting any unnecessary contact. Can be deleted by giving First Name, Last Name or Phone number.**<br/>
**5. Viewing all contacts in the directory at the same time.**<br/>

C Programming Language has been used. Linked Lists concepts have also been included. Additional Features which can be included are adding multiple phone numbers for a contact, adding home and work specific details and so on.
